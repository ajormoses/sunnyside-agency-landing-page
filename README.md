[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
**To do this challenge, you need a strong understanding of HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT**

- [The challenge](#the-challenge)
  My challenge is to build up this feature illustration using HTML & CSS and JavaScript and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
  The only assets we provide in this challenge are provided in the image folder. You need to create everything else using HTML & CSS!

  You will find all the required assets in the `/images` and `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.
